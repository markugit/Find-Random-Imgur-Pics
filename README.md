# Find-Random-Imgur-Pics
There are two parts: class ImguRand and class CallImguRand.

the files that are found download to the local directory.

it takes the script a  while to find pictures.

the current state of the program writes to your local disk alot,
would recommend using it on an expendable hard drive or usb drive.

callImguRand is there just to act as a shell to instantiate ImguRand objects.

I did it this way so that the object is easily deployable by other people, 
while also not requiring other people to create their own shells to test it out.

for mor elaborate information, look in the java doc comments.
